## Unique Rendering Engine

In order to ensure the highest possible level of image resolution, our API relies on a powerful rendering engine capable of processing, storing and returning all sorts of website content (including Webfonts, CSS3, Graphs, Canvas, and more!) within just a few seconds. 

Each screenshot is assigned to a separate and unique server entity, allowing us to provide an unparalleled level of image quality and speed for each API request, even when capturing the full height and width of a website.

## Features & Integration

Full API documentation and features are available at [https://screenshotlayer.com](https://screenshotlayer.com).

Long story short - the main API Functionalities are:

* **Superior Rendering**:
Upon comparison with all the other screenshot automation APIs out there you will notice clear differences in image quality. Our superior rendering engine delivers razor-sharp screenshots of any website, for any user, at any time. 

* **Full-Height Captures, Thumbnails**:
Capture the `full height` of a website, or specify a custom thumbnail width tailored for your application or website. 

* **Viewport Control**:
Exercise full control over your screenshot `viewports`. Generate snapshots for existing mobile devices, tablets, or desktops, or simply specify your own dimensions.

* **Placeholder images**:
For the very few seconds your screenshot is loading, you can provide a placeholder image to display on your page, or simply use our default placeholder.

* **Custom CSS**:
Modify your target website by injecting a CSS stylesheet of your own, simply by appending it as a file URL to your API request.

* **Timing**:
Specify a custom `delay` in order to let any animations on your target website finish loading, specify a custom caching time (`ttl` - time-to-live), or force the API to refresh your screenshot.

* **Export Options**:
Upload your files directly to your `AWS S3 Bucket` or export them to a custom `ftp` server path.

* **and much more**:
Prevent your API access from being abused by specifying `secret key` and encrypting your URL, specify custom `HTTP User-agent` and `Accept-language` headers, ...
